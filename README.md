# Exploratory Data Analysis on Income Data

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on income data sourced from the 1994 Census Bureau database. The dataset was originally collected by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker as part of their work in Data Mining and Visualization at Silicon Graphics.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to ascertain whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. This involves a detailed exploration of various demographic and employment-related factors present in the dataset to understand their impact on income levels.

## Dataset
The dataset, `adult.csv`, consists of anonymized records from the 1994 Census Bureau database and includes attributes such as age, education, occupation, and income.

## Analysis Highlights
- The analysis provides insights into the distribution of income across different demographic groups.
- Key factors influencing income levels, such as education, occupation, and work hours, are explored.
- The relationship between various attributes and their impact on the likelihood of having an income over $50,000 is examined.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process (`EDA-income.ipynb`).

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `EDA-income.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Run the notebook cells to replicate the analysis.
